- [x] baseline functions and script to run
- [ ] unbalanced data: test with sklearn, not improved much
- [ ] missing value : 
  - [x] mean, median, zero: zero is the best (or maybe +999)
  - [ ] predict to fill, missing value have relationship to predictions
  - there should be some columns with missing value have huge 'influence' on the result, find them and drop or using different classifier
- [x] outliers 
- [ ] Polynomial test with sklearn, not improved much
- [x] Standardization
- [ ] Maybe add kfold validation into classifier function to get the best w and loss
